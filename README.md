Traks - a translation system for React/JSX.

### Demo

To see a demo of it in action, go here: https://github.com/aktiedysten/traks-zoo


### Introduction
The basic idea is to add elements in your JSX code like this:
```js
<T>You have {count} unread message(s)</T>
```

Then you run `bin/traks update` (in this example `bin/traks update --langs en,da`) which searches for `<T>` tags in your source code.
New tags are automatically added to your translations file, and looks like this:

```js
	"e8c2410dd77c": {
		"_new": true, // FIXME remove this line when translation is done
		"en": (count) => <O>You have {count} unread message(s)</O>,
		"da": (count) => <O>You have {count} unread message(s)</O>,
	},
```

You can then translate it and even handle plural/singular cases by changing it into this:
```js
	"e8c2410dd77c": {
		"en": (count) => {
			switch (count) {
			case 0: return <O>You have no unread messages</O>;
			case 1: return <O>You have 1 unread message</O>;
			default: return <O>You have {count} unread messages</O>;
			}
		},
		"da": (count) => {
			switch (count) {
			case 0: return <O>Du har ingen ulæste beskeder</O>;
			case 1: return <O>Du har 1 ulæst besked</O>;
			default: return <O>Du har {count} ulæste beskeder</O>;
			}
		},
	},
```

### Caveats
 - It's very much alpha software at this point, but we use it at Aktiedysten ApS
 - The "magic" in traks relies on a custom Babel code transform (see `react-app.js`);
   it has only been tested with an "ejected" `create-react-app` app (and you need to eject it because
   you can't change Babel presets otherwise). You can find a working
   demo here: https://github.com/aktiedysten/traks-zoo - the commit history  of `traks-zoo`
   also serves as a series of step for setting up traks.
 - There are restrictions on how you can use `<T>` tags; see the autogenerated `traks.js` and
   `traks-translations.js` files for documentation on this.
   
### Why?

The two most popular translation solutions for React are `react-intl` and `react-i18next`.
Both have a verbose and unnatural syntax, and want you to assign keys to every translation.
I have previously worked with `gettext` which is intuitive to work with, has a light syntax and it automatically
extracts translation strings from your source code. So, I desired something similar for React.

### TODO
 - `gettext` has "fuzzy string matching" and I'd like something similar, e.g. if you change `<T>Hello world</T>` to 
   `<T>Hello world!</T>`, then `traks update` currently marks the old one as deleted and adds the new one.
   Since they look similar it should instead ask if you want to migrate the translation.
